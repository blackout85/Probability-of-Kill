# Probability-of-Kill
Small program I wrote based upon the mathematical model for single-shot probability of kill, and of miss, described by
J.S Przemieniecki in "Mathematical Methods in Defense Analyis, 3rd Edition". The computation assumes no systematic error
and that the firing weapon is aiming at the center of the target. Additionally, an LEP (linear error probable) in-range of 0.6745
is assumed for calculation purposes. The program prompts the user for two inputs: REP (range error probable) of the firing weapon, as well as target length.
